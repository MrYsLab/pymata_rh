# What is pymata_rh? 

[Pymata_rh](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata_rh) is a Python 3 (Version 3.7 or above)  [Application Programming 
Interface (API).](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata_rh/blob/master/html/pymata_rh/index.html)
It is Windows, macOS and, Linux compatible, allowing you to easily create Python scripts to control and monitor the Robo HAT MM1.

## Robot HAT MM1 Pin Names To Pin Number Map And Supported Pin Modes

**MM1 Pin Name**|**Digital / Analog Pin #**|**Digital Input**|**Digital Output**|**PWM**|**Analog Input**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Servo1|2|Yes|Yes|Yes|No
Servo2|3|Yes|Yes|Yes|No
Servo3|4|Yes|Yes|No|No
Servo4|5|Yes|Yes|No|No
Servo5|6|Yes|Yes|Yes|No
Servo6|7|Yes|Yes|Yes|No
Servo7|8|Yes|Yes|Yes|No
Servo8|9|Yes|Yes|Yes|No
NeoPixel |11|Yes|Yes|Yes|No      
LED      | 13|No|Yes|No|No
RCC1     | 14 / A0 |Yes|Yes|No|Yes
RCC2     | 15 / A1 |Yes|Yes|No|Yes
RCC3     | 16 / A2 |Yes|Yes|No|Yes
RCC4     | 17 / A3 |Yes|Yes|No|Yes

### NOTES:
* All digital pins support digital input pull-up mode.
* All analog input pins may be configured as digital inputs or outputs as well.
* Currently, there is no library support provided within pymata_rh to control NeoPixels. However, the pin may be used as a digital pin.

## API Support
The API not only supports the pins and modes listed above, but the pymata_rh API also
provides support for:

* Servo motors.
* The onboard INA219 current, shunt, and power monitor.
* The onboard MPU9250 nine-axis motion tracking device.
* External i2c devices. 
* DHT 11 and 22 temperature sensors.
* HC-SR04 sonar distance sensors.

**NOTE: ** You may need to connect a power supply that provides adequate current capacity for your application.

## Implemented Using The Firmata Protocol

The API is implemented using the
 [Firmata protocol](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) in conjunction with FirmataExpress,
custom firmware you install on the Robo HAT MM1.
Communication between the Python script and the Robo HAT MM1 is accomplished over a serial link at 115200 baud.


### A [User's Guide is available,](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata_rh/index.html) containing an annotated API as well as links to working examples.


## Major features

* **Fully documented <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata_rh/blob/master/html/pymata_rh/index.html" target="_blank">intuitive API</a>**


* **Python 3.7+ compatible.**

* **Set the pin mode and go!**

* **Data change events may be associated with a callback function, or each pin can be polled for its last event change.**

    * **Each data change event is time-stamped and logged.**


Here is an example that demonstrates receiving asynchronous digital pin state data change notifications for pin 2 using
 callback notifications.

The API is quite simple to use. Here are the steps involved in creating a simple application.

1. Set a pin mode for the pin and register a callback function.
2. Have your application sit in a loop waiting for notifications.
    
When pymata_rh executes the callback method you specified, the data parameter is populated with 
a list of items that describe the change event, including a time-stamp.


```python
from pymata_rh import pymata_rh
import time

class DigitalInput:
    """
    Set a pin for digital input and received all data changes
    in the callback method
    """
    def __init__(self, pin):
        """
        Set a pin as a digital input
        :param pin: digital pin number
        """

        # Indices into the callback report data
        self.CB_PIN_MODE = 0
        self.CB_PIN = 1
        self.CB_VALUE = 2
        self.CB_TIME = 3

        # Instantiate this class with the pymata_rh API
        self.device = pymata_rh.PymataRh()

        # Set the pin mode and specify the callback method.
        self.device.set_pin_mode_digital_input(pin, callback=self.the_callback)

        # Keep the program running and wait for callback events.
        while True:
            try:
                time.sleep(1)
            # If user hits Control-C, exit cleanly.
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                self.device.shutdown()

    def the_callback(self, data):
        """
        A callback function to report data changes.
        This will print the pin number, its reported value
        the pin type (digital, analog, etc.) and
        the date and time when the change occurred

        :param data: [pin, current reported value, pin_mode, timestamp]
        """
        # Convert the date stamp to readable format
        date = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.localtime(data[self.CB_TIME]))

        # Print the pin, current value and time and date of the pin change event.
        print(f'Pin: {data[self.CB_PIN]} Value: {data[self.CB_VALUE]} Time Stamp: {date}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Monitor Pin 2 For Digital Input changes
    DigitalInput(2)

```

Sample console output as input change events occur:
```bash
Pin: 2 Value: 0 Time Stamp: 2020-03-10 13:26:22
Pin: 2 Value: 1 Time Stamp: 2020-03-10 13:26:27
```
