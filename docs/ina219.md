# Interacting With The INA219

Pymata_rh provides a separate API method call to retrieve each of the measurements that an
INA219 can perform.

The following API methods to allow you to control and monitor the INA219:

* ina_initialize
* ina_read_bus_voltage
* ina_read_bus_voltage_last
* ina_read_bus_current
* ina_read_bus_current_last
* ina_read_power
* ina_read_power_last
* ina_read_shunt_voltage
* ina_read_shunt_voltage_last
* ina_read_supply_voltage
* ina_read_supply_voltage_last

Each of the methods that end in **_last** retrieves the last data values read from the device.
These methods do not do a physical read of the INA219.

All the other methods that do not end with **_last** perform a physical read of the device.

## ina_initialize

```python 
def ina_initialize(self, address=64, shunt_ohms=0.2, 
                   max_expected_amps=0.2, callback=None)

    This method instantiates an INA219 object.

    :param address: The i2c address of the device

    :param shunt_ohms: The shunt resistance in ohms

    :param max_expected_amps: The maximum expected current in amps

    :param callback: Callback method that will INA219 callbacks

    Note: There is a single callback shared by all INA methods.

```
This method **must** be called before calling any of the other INA219 methods. Typically, 
you can accept all of the default
values. If you wish to have your application automatically notified of any INA219 reads, you must specify a callback
function. 

Using a callback is optional but highly recommended. A callback function ensures that your application receives
the latest INA219 data automatically without any polling interaction. If you do not specify a callback method, you 
may still poll for
the latest reported values using the INA219 methods that end in *_last*

The data frame returned as a result of any of the reads is described in the specific
read methods.

For a discussion on callbacks and polling, please refer 
[to this section](polling.md) of the document.
