# TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS

Powering both Robot HAT MM1 connected devices (such as motors) and the Robot HAT MM1 micro-controller
from your computer's USB connector or Raspberry Pi
may exceed the maximum current capabilities of the USB port or the Raspberry Pi power supply.
In those cases, use a separate power supply for the
connected device.
