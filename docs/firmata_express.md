<p>3. Click on the Install button.</p>


<p> 4. FirmataExpress also requires that the Ultrasonic library
by Erick Sim√µes be installed.</p>
Using the Arduino IDE, install the [ultrasonic library](https://github.com/ErickSimoes/Ultrasonic). Click on Tools/Manage Libraries
and select Ultrasonic and then click Install.

When pymata_rh is instantiated, the version of FirmataExpress is checked for
compatibility. If an incompatible version is found,
a RuntimeError exception will be raised. The correct version to be used is identified and printed
on the console.

## Setting The FirmataExpress Instance ID

FirmataExpress, in conjunction with pymata_rh, can automatically
associate a Pymata Express application with a specific Arduino board
plugged into your computer.

If you only have a single Arduino connected at a time, you do not need to do anything. However,
if you wish to run multiple Arduinos, you will need to assign a unique ID number to each
Arduino. The ID number is then supplied as an input parameter when your application
 is instantiated.

The Pymata Express instance parameter is discussed
[here](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-express/guidelines/#parameter-arduino_instance_id).

To set the ID number in FirmataExpress, load the FirmataExpress sketch into the Arduino IDE.
Look for the following line:

```
#define ARDUINO_INSTANCE_ID         1
```

Modify the value of 1 to the matching number you will use with Pymata Express.

You may then compile and upload FirmataExpress to your Arduino.
